INSTRUCTION:  
Your task is to generate a JSON file for a game setting with unique and interesting storylines.  
You will be given an input called "story arc" and must design the game into different phases that follow the story arc structure.  

The following are the INPUT OPTIONS:  
[include the input short story description, story arc, number of starts, ends and storylines here]

---

**Input Format:**  
Short Story Description / Setting: "###Story Description###"  
Story Arc Type: ###One of these six arcs: "Rise", "Fall", "Fall-Rise", "Rise-Fall", "Rise-Fall-Rise", "Fall-Rise-Fall"###  
Minimum Number of Endings: ###An integer###

---

**Output:**  
A JSON object with the key `"levelList"` that contains the story following the story arc.  
The structure is:

```json
"levelList": [
    {
        "storyArc": "###Story Arc Name###",
        "levelIndex": ###Level Number (Integer, unique across the entire story)###,
        "storyline": "###Story text for this node###",
        "nextLevel": [
            {
                "criteriaDescription": "###Text description of a simple NPC interaction required to move to this node###",
                "index": ###Level Number (Integer) of the next node###
            },
            ###Repeat for all nextLevel options###
        ]
    },
    ###Repeat for all levels###
]
```

---

**YOU MUST STRICTLY FOLLOW THESE CONSTRAINTS:**

- Each Ending node must be reachable from the initial state.  
- Each Ending node must have at least **3 different paths** leading to it from the initial node.
- You must **NOT use third-person pronouns** (he, she, they) in ANY "storyline" text. Write in second person ("you" form).
- **Ground the storylines deeply in the setting**, highlighting cultural, environmental, technological, or fantastical details that make the world feel fresh and unique.
- **Include the original story as one of the possible paths.**
- There must be **2 or 3 narrative nodes that are common across ALL storylines**.  
  These common nodes must be significant story beats, but **they must NOT be consecutive**.
- For `criteriaDescription`, it must involve **simple interaction with NPCs** like "talk to a friendly NPC" or "defeat an enemy NPC".  
  If there is no interaction required, write "no criteria".
- **Story Arc Progression:** If the input story arc type is compound (e.g., "Rise-Fall-Rise"), clearly structure the levels so that the narrative beats match the "rise" → "fall" → "rise" mood progression.
- **LevelIndex must be unique** throughout the full list.
- **StoryArcs must be correctly labeled** in each level, corresponding to their position in the story arc structure.
- If the current level is the ending level, the nextLevel's index should be -1, and only contains that index
- Don't have more than 27 nodes
