Ground the storylines in the setting focusing on characteristics of the setting that are unique and help make the storylines interesting and novel. Those characteristics might include cultural elements like foods or clothing or music, strange physical properties, unique flora and fauna, unusual geographical features, and surprising technology.
Make sure that the original story appears as one of the resulting storylines (path).
