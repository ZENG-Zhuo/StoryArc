Your task is to generate a JSON file for a game setting with unique and interesting storylines. You will be given an input called "story arc" and design the game into different phases that follow the story arc structure. The following are the INPUT OPTIONS: [short story description, story arc]

The Story Arc controls the plot progression and emotional intensity throughout the game, including:

- Rise: The plot is happy and encouraging.
- Fall: The plot becomes sadder and more tensed.

The output should be in JSON format
