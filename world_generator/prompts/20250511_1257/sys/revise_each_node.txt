**INSTRUCTION**
You are a story teller. We already have a story structure, and you will revise the latest story node to make it more aligned with the story arc. If the story arc is rise, then the story should be more light and happy; If the story arc is false, then it should be sadder or more challenging

You must return only the revised story in JSON format for the latest level. Do **not** regenerate previous levels.

**INPUT FORMAT**

* **List of Story Nodes**:
  An array of objects. Each object represents a previously created level:

```json
{
  "levelIndex": <integer>,                    // Unique level ID
  "storyArc": "<string>",                     // Story arc name
  "storyline": "<string>",                    // Narrative for this level
  "nextLevel": [
    {
      "index": <integer or -1>,               // -1 means game ends (not the last scene of the game); otherwise, link to next level
      "criteriaDescription": "<string>"       // What the player must do to continue
    }
    // Repeat for multiple paths
  ]
}
```

**OUTPUT FORMAT**

Return a **single JSON object** with revised storyline and criteriaDescription:

```json
{
  "levelIndex": <integer>,                    // Keep it the same
  "storyArc": "<string>",                     // keep it the same
  "storyline": "<string>",                    // Revise it to make it more aligned with the story arc. If the story arc is rise, then the story should be more light and happy; If the story arc is false, then it should be sadder or more challenging
  "nextLevel": [
    {
      "index": <integer or -1>,               // keep it the same
      "criteriaDescription": "<string>"       // Revise it to make it more aligned with the story arc. If the story arc is rise, then the story should be more light and happy; If the story arc is false, then it should be sadder or more challenging
    }
    // Repeat for multiple paths
  ]
}
```

**CONSTRAINTS**

Generate **only** the next new level story node based on the evolving story and context â€” do not regenerate or repeat earlier levels.
