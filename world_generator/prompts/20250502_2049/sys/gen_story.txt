INSTRUCTION: Your task is to generate a JSON file for a game setting with unique and interesting storylines. You will be given an input called "story arc" and design the game into different phases that follow the story arc structure. The following are the INPUT OPTIONS: [include the input short story description, story arc, number of starts, ends and storylines here]

  

 Input Format:

 Short Story Description / Setting: "###Story Description###"

 Story Arc Type: ###One of these six arcs: "Rise", "Fall", "Fall-Rise", "Rise-Fall", "Rise-Fall-Rise", "Fall-Rise-Fall"

 Minimum number of ending: ###An integer###

  

 Output: A JSON file that contains the story following story arc.

 "levelList": [

 {

 "levelIndex": ###Unique node number as an integer for each node###,

 "storyArc": "###Corresponding story arc###",

 "storyline": "###Story line in this node###",

 "nextLevel": [

 {

 "index": "###next node index or -1 if this is an "END" node###"

 "criteriaDescription": "###Text description of the criteria needs to be satisfied in order to reach to this node from previous node###"

 },

 ### Repeat for all other "nextLevel" ###

 ],

 },

 {

 "levelIndex": ###Unique node number as an integer for each node###,

 "storyArc": "###Corresponding story arc###",

 "storyline": "###Story line in this node###",

 "nextLevel": [

 {

 "index": "###next node index or -1 if this is an "END" node###"

 "criteriaDescription": "###Text description of the criteria needs to be satisfied in order to reach to this node from previous node###"

 },

 ### Repeat for all other "nextLevel" ###

 ],

 },

 ### Repeat for all nodes ###

 ]

  

 YOU MUST STRICTLY FOLLOW THESE CONSTRAINTS:


If the story node has reached the end of the story ("END" node), the "index" within "nextLevel" must be marked as "-1" as an integer.
All node MUST be reachable from initial state. In other words, if we start from node with index 1, then following the choices in "nextLevel", it should be able to reach any one of the end node with index "-1".
The graph formed by story nodes and edges must be a DAG
For each path from the initial node to the end node, it must follow the story arc defined in the input.
"END" node must has an enemy NPC to serve as the final boss.
No matter how many "end" nodes are required by the input. There must be at least 3 different paths to reach each end node from the initial node.
Do NOT use third person pronouns in ANY nodes.
Ground the storylines in the setting focusing on characteristics of the setting that are unique and help make the storylines interesting and novel. Those characteristics might include cultural elements like foods or clothing or music, strange physical properties, unique flora and fauna, unusual geographical features, and surprising technology.
Make sure that the original story appears as one of the resulting storylines (path).
THERE MUST BE 2 OR 3 NODES THAT ARE COMMON IN ALL THE STORYLINES. These must be the important narrative nodes in the story. The common beats must not be consecutive.
For the criteriaDescription, it MUST be simple interaction with NPCs and/or items (only limited to pick up or use an item). In the most ideal situation, For example, talk to a friendly NPC, kill an enemy NPC, pick up an item, deliver the item to a NPC. Otherwise, you may put "no criteria".
